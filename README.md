### Brief Project Description
This project explores the relationship between the uptake of residential solar systems in NSW, Australia and grid energy demand between roughly 2010 and 2020.

In particular, our research team was aiming to answer the following question:
“Has the uptake of residential solar systems reduced the dynamic range of electricity demand?”

Our process was as follows:
1. Peruse existing literature
2. Collect data
3. Clean and explore data
4. Create simple model
5. Create sophisticated model
6. Compare and select most effective model
7. Determine answer to research question

### Repository structure

The repository has the following folder structure:

- data: Datasets used for analysis 
  - processed: The final dataset used for modeling
  - raw: All raw data collected/used for analysis
- images: Images derived from the analysis and modeling
  - exploratory

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(CCP)
library(CCA)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

The permutation test is performed below

```{r permutation test}
##the data used here is imported from the cleaned and prepard data produced at the end of the Python EDA Script
all_dat <- read.csv("~/Academic/Final project/Data/full_data.csv")

#scale the data
X = subset(all_dat,select = -c(demand_min,demand_max,datetime))
Y = subset(all_dat,select = c(demand_min,demand_max))
Xs <- scale(X)
Ys <- scale(Y)

#perform the permutation test
A = p.perm(Xs,Ys)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

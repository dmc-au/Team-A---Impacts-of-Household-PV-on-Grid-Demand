Questions:

-   Is there a word limit for the report

    -   35 pages, not word limit

Notes:

-   It is more important to talk about our research question, why is
    > what we are doing important

-   The model itself doesn't have be to super complicated

-   If we can explain something interesting, it would be better

-   Our research question can grow continuously, the plan we submit is
    > not final

-   The main point is how to find something interesting, something that
    > can contribute to the existing knowledge base

-   We need to have very specific research question, so scope doesn't
    > get out of hand

    -   Being specific means you have filtered out all other factors,
        > where you can make convincing assumptions on those factors, so
        > you can focus on your chosen specific mechanism

    -   E.g.

-   We can also focus our research question on a "specific interesting
    > case" which doesn't have to be generalisable

    -   E.g. how to better predict energy demand during a national wide
        > lockdown

    -   If we can make slightly better performing model that what we can
        > find in literature for a specific case, that would be good

-   Each person should have a specialisation

    -   E.g. data exploration, modelling,

-   Referencing journal articles is not required but is recommended.

-   The literature review is an ongoing process. We need to have
    > reviewed enough for the Project Plan that we have a good idea of
    > the direction and scope of the project but we can perform an more
    > extensive review as we go.

-   We do not want to just build a couple of models and compare their
    > performance. The Project should be more collaborative and
    > iterative. Finding new issues and interests and tackling them as a
    > group.

-   We don\'t have to use the given dataset, our research question just
    > has to be on topic

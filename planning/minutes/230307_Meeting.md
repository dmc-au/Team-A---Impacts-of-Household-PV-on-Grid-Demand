    -   Biggest determinants of demand: temperature, historical demand,
         historical forecasts (not provided?)

    -   Synthetic data can help in scenario analysis

    -   "In this project, you are not given a closed task by your
         \"client\". As a group, you should come up with your own
         research question related to the electricity market and
         provide a thorough analysis using (part of) the data provided
         (potentially incorporating external data you can find by
         yourselves)."

    -   "As a first step, you need to make a plan that (i) defines an
         interesting question and (ii) allows you to answer the
         question in the assigned timeline."

# Meeting 16/03/23 with Lecturer

Activity:

-   Team is reviewing literature and exploring data.

-   We've created some interpolation code for interpolating temperature
    > data.

-   We're in the process of acquiring some data from BOM for cloud
    > cover.

    -   BOM models related to future predicted temperatures, cloud cover
        > etc.

Questions:

-   Is it required to have code as deliverables in GitHub?

    -   This is ideal for easy reproducibility. Explain clearly why
        > choices were made and how to reproduce the work.

-   Some clarity on A2: Four posts on the forum + a summary description
    > of 500 words? Does the rubric apply to all 5 items, or just the
    > summary?

    -   Yes.

-   Is there an expected weighting for the sections in the report?

    -   Extrapolate based on the percentage weightings in the rubric.

    -   1 idea per paragraph; 5 or 6 lines; linear flow of ideas.

    -   Abstract

    -   Introduction

    -   Literature review

    -   Material and methods (software, description of data,
        > pre-processing, assumptions and modelling methods)

        -   Provide evidence in model choice (e.g. ref papers,
            > experience from prior, etc)

    -   Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

    -   Analysis of results

    -   Discussion, conclusion, and further issues

Actions:

-   Set up an agenda for the next meeting

Notes:

-   It's good to try various models and compare.

-   Pierre to provide references on interpolation methods for
    > temperature

    -   https://otexts.com/fpp3/tscv.html

-   Focus on the process, method, why, not the sophistication of the
    > model

-   Make sure to justify assumption sin the report.

-   The research question needs to be clear, and be clear why it's
    > important (and specifically now).

-   Can explain why things don't work

    -   Not enough time

    -   Data not freely available

    -   But provide explanation, e.g. we could use computer vision to
        > identify solar panels from satellite images, but not enough
        > resolution, so need military sats, etc

-   What kind of solar panels? Efficiency? Size? Generation? Downsides?

-   In Discussion, include what future work could be done to improve
    > what we've done

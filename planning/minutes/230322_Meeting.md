## Previous Actions

-   Dave: Set up next team meeting.

-   Zoren: Set up this week's meeting w/ lecturer, including agenda in
     request and calendar invite.

-   Sam: Explore range of (min and max) grid demand on days relative to
     weather (using rain as proxy?), using a basic linear model
     (precipitation + temperature).

    -   Also look at how broad solar uptake affects these peaks.

    -   Dave: So we could phrase our research question as "What effect
         does the uptake of residential solar have on the dynamic range
         of grid demand?"

-   Dave: Help Sam to merge to main in Github.

-   Dave: Investigate possible duplicates in demand data.

Agenda:

-   Update on our data exploration progress

-   Confirm our refined research question

-   [What is the best way to divide up modelling/coding work between
     team members]{.mark}

-   [Data normalisation: how do you normalise parameters that keeps
     growing (e.g. solar uptake)?]{.mark}

1.  [Update on our data exploration progress]{.mark}

2.  [Confirm our refined research question]{.mark}

    a.  Has the uptake of residential solar systems reduced the dynamic
         range of electricity demand in NSW?

    b.  Dynamic range = peak - trough

    c.  Looking into daily and weekly peak but daily allows more
         sophisticated models

    d.  AEMO price

    e.  Potentially look into financial aspects

        i.  Price of PV panels

    f.  Can briefly cover

3.  [What is the best way to divide up modelling/coding work between
     team members?]{.mark}

    a.  [Can create different models which are divided up between
         members]{.mark}

    b.  [Fit a single model but everyone tries different methods]{.mark}

    c.  [Iterate between data analysis and the model]{.mark}

    d.  [Google Collab is approved by lecturers]{.mark}

        i.  [Can connect Collab to Github]{.mark}

4.  [Data normalisation: how do you normalise parameters that keeps
     growing (e.g. solar uptake)?]{.mark}

    a.  [Normalisation is useful for convergence]{.mark}

    b.  [With varying variance wrt time, we will need a time input, look
         into GARCH/variance inflation factor]{.mark}

        i.  [ridge/lasso/PLS regression]{.mark}

        ii. [Fpp3 (otexts fpp3)]{.mark}

    c.  

5.  [Clarification on presentation rubric, specifically regarding to
     what extent should text be used in the slides.]{.mark}

    a.  [For report, target audience is for data science students,
         academics]{.mark}

    b.  [For presentation, target audience is CEOs, decision makers who
         are not well versed in data science]{.mark}

        i.  [What are assumptions, findings and explain]{.mark}
